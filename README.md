# (WIP) AIMW: AI Middleware

A runtime-independent Rust Library for your favorite AI Services like OpenAI. 

## There is already a Rust Library for OpenAI, why another one?

This crate does not contain a runtime. Instead, it is designed to be used with any runtime like `tokio`, `async-std`, `js-sys`, `reqwest`, etc. The runtime is abstrated as an async trait.

## WIP

This crate is in its early development. The version `0.0.0` is used to reserve the name on crates.io.
